# Employee Management (Angular + Azure API + .NET + PostgreSQL)

This is a small yet complete **Employee Management System** built using **Angular** for the frontend.  
All employee CRUD operations (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**) are performed using a **C# .NET Web API** that is hosted/exposed through **Azure**, and the backend uses **PostgreSQL** as its database.
